# /get-started — Your first collaboration interface

This skill transforms a cloned repository into a personalized collaboration environment. It asks questions, listens, and builds — the user walks away with a functional AI identity, initial memories, and a configured workspace.

## When to use

- When a new user clones the repository and wants to set up their own collaboration interface.
- When someone types `/get-started` for the first time.
- **Runs only once per project setup.** After initial onboarding, the user works with `/start`, `/make-public`, and `/wrap-up`.

## Tone

This is the Didactic moment. Be warm, clear, and encouraging. The user may be experiencing Claude Code's collaboration features for the first time. Don't overwhelm — guide. Each question should feel like a conversation, not a form.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Welcome

Greet the user and explain what's about to happen:

> "Welcome. I'm going to ask you a few questions to set up your collaboration interface. By the end, you'll have an AI with a name, personality, and enough context about you to be useful from the very first conversation. Takes about 5 minutes. Ready?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Phase 2 — Understand the human

Ask these questions **one at a time**. Don't dump them all at once. Wait for each answer before asking the next. React naturally — acknowledge, ask follow-ups if something is interesting or unclear.

#### Question 1 — Who are you?

> "First — tell me about yourself. What do you do? What's your role? No need for a formal bio — just enough for me to understand where you're coming from."

**What we're capturing:** Role, experience, skill level. This becomes the `user` memory.

#### Question 2 — What are you building?

> "What project are you going to use with this collaboration? What's the goal? Even if it's early or vague, tell me what you're aiming for."

**What we're capturing:** Project context, goals, motivation. This becomes the `project` memory.

#### Question 3 — How do you like to work?

> "How do you prefer working with an AI? Some people want a tool that executes fast and stays quiet. Others want a partner that questions and asks things. Some want a teacher. What feels right for you?"

**What we're capturing:** Collaboration style. This shapes the AI's personality.

#### Question 4 — What should the AI avoid?

> "Is there anything that annoys you when working with AI? Things it does that you wish it wouldn't? Be specific — this is where the real calibration happens."

**What we're capturing:** Anti-patterns to avoid. This becomes a `feedback` memory.

#### Question 5 — Name and language

> "Two quick ones: What do you want to call your AI? (A name makes everything more consistent — pick whatever feels right.) And what language should we use in conversations?"

**What we're capturing:** AI name, conversation language.

### Phase 3 — Build the identity

Based on the answers, generate the user's `CLAUDE.md` at the project root. This file is **the user's identity file** — it's what Claude Code reads automatically. The framework documentation lives in the `guides/` folder.

**Important:** The repository comes with a placeholder `CLAUDE.md`. This phase overwrites it with the user's personalized version.

**Generation rules:**
- Use `templates/CLAUDE.md` as the structural base.
- Fill in the identity (name, role) from Questions 5 and 3.
- Design 2-3 personality traits mapped to specific contexts, based on Question 3.
  - If the user wants a partner that questions, add a Pragmatic trait.
  - If the user wants a teacher, add a Didactic trait.
  - If the user wants speed and efficiency, add an Executor trait.
  - Adapt and name the traits naturally. Build what fits the user's profile.
- Write behavior rules based on Questions 3 and 4.
- Set language conventions from Question 5.
- Include the standard session lifecycle (skills section).
- Leave "Current state" with the project info from Question 2.
- Add a reference line at the top: `> For framework documentation, see the [guides](guides/).`

**Show the generated CLAUDE.md to the user and ask for approval before saving.**

### Phase 4 — Build initial memories

Create the following memory files in `memory/`:

#### memory/MEMORY.md (index)

Build the index with entries for each memory file created.

#### memory/user_profile.md

```markdown
---
name: User profile
description: [One line based on Question 1 answers]
type: user
---

[Structured content from Question 1. Role, experience, what they value.]
```

#### memory/project_context.md

```markdown
---
name: Project context
description: [One line based on Question 2 answers]
type: project
---

[What they're building, why, what phase they're in.]

**Why:** [Motivation — in the user's own words.]

**How to apply:** [How this context should shape the AI's suggestions.]
```

#### memory/feedback_preferences.md

```markdown
---
name: Collaboration preferences
description: [One line based on Questions 3 and 4]
type: feedback
---

[What the user wants and doesn't want from the AI.]

**Why:** [Reasoning, if provided.]

**How to apply:** [Specific behavioral adjustments.]
```

#### memory/feedback_language.md

```markdown
---
name: Language convention
description: Files in [language], conversations in [user's language].
type: feedback
---

All files, folder names, code, comments, and written content should be in [language].
Conversations with the user are in [language].

**Why:** [Reason based on the user's choice.]

**How to apply:** Every file created or edited must follow the convention. Chat responses stay in [language].
```

**Also sync all memory files to the system folder** (`.claude/projects/` path) so they load automatically in future conversations.

### Phase 5 — Set up workspace

Create the folder structure if it doesn't exist:

```
memory/           — Already created with the files above
exchange/
├── inbox/        — User places files here for the AI to process
└── outbox/       — AI delivers files here
    └── drafts/   — Work in progress
```

Check that `.gitignore` exists and covers `memory/`, `exchange/`, and `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### Phase 5.5 — Scope disclaimer

Before the first greeting, explicitly inform the user about what was installed and where:

> "Quick note about what just happened on your system: everything I created is **inside this project folder**. Skills, memories, identity — all local. Nothing was installed globally in your `~/.claude/` configuration. Your other projects and your existing Claude Code setup are completely untouched.
>
> If you want `/start` to work globally (to use in any project), you'd need to manually copy it to `~/.claude/skills/start/`. But that's entirely optional — by default, everything stays local."

**This disclaimer is mandatory.** The user must know what happened on their system before onboarding closes.

### Phase 6 — First greeting

After everything is set up, do one last thing: **run a mini `/start`**. Load the CLAUDE.md that was just created, load the memories that were just written, and greet the user as the new AI — in character, with the personality that was just defined.

This is the moment it becomes real. The user should feel the difference between talking to generic Claude and talking to *their AI*.

Closing example:

> "[AI Name] here. I know who you are, what you're building, and how you like to work. Next time you open a conversation, say `/start` and I'll be ready. Let's build."

## Rules

- **One question at a time.** Never dump all questions in one message.
- **React to answers.** Acknowledge what the user says. Ask follow-ups when needed. It's a conversation, not a form.
- **Show before saving.** Always show the generated CLAUDE.md and ask for approval before writing.
- **Don't over-ask.** Five questions is the base. If the user gives rich answers, you may not need all of them. If answers are short, ask one or two follow-ups — but don't interrogate.
- **Don't force a personality model.** Personality traits should fit the user, not copy an original. If someone wants a quiet, efficient assistant — build that. Not everyone needs a provocateur.
- **Sync memories in both locations.** Project `memory/` folder AND system `.claude/projects/` folder.
- **This skill runs once.** After setup, the user works with `/start`, `/make-public`, and `/wrap-up`. If they want to redo it, they can run `/get-started` again — it will overwrite.
- **Be didactic.** This is a teaching moment. The user is learning a new way to work with AI. Make it feel natural, not technical.
