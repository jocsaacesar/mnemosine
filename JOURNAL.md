# Journal

Decisions, learnings, and insights from building a collaboration interface with Claude Code.

Each entry answers three questions:
- **What we decided**
- **Why**
- **What we learned**

## 2026-04-07 — /comece-por-aqui: onboarding as a conversation, not a manual

**What we decided:** Create an onboarding skill that interviews new users one question at a time — who they are, what they're building, how they work, what to avoid, and what to call their AI — then builds a complete personalized setup from the answers.

**Why:** A repo with great documentation still fails if the user doesn't know where to start. Templates require reading instructions and filling blanks. An interview requires only answering questions. The difference: the user thinks about *themselves* instead of thinking about *the system*.

**What we learned:** The entry point to a framework shouldn't teach the framework — it should ask the right questions. Understanding comes later, through use. The onboarding skill doesn't explain memory types or skill anatomy. It just asks "who are you?" and builds from there.

## 2026-04-07 — /tornar-publico skill: automating the private-to-public bridge

**What we decided:** Create a dedicated skill that audits session work, sanitizes personal data, and publishes pedagogically valuable content to the public folders — with mandatory user confirmation before any commit.

**Why:** Manually separating personal from public every session is tedious and error-prone. But full automation without oversight is dangerous with personal data. The skill sits in the middle: it does the work, but the human approves the result.

**What we learned:** The session lifecycle now has three beats: `/iniciar` (open), `/tornar-publico` (publish), `/ate-a-proxima` (close). The publish step is distinct from the close step because publishing requires conscious review — it's not something you do on autopilot while saying goodbye.

## 2026-04-07 — Project restructured for public sharing

**What we decided:** Transform the private Jiim Hawkins workspace into a public repository documenting the collaboration interface framework. Added guides, templates, and a journal alongside the living project.

**Why:** The process of building identity, memory, and skills for Claude Code turned out to be valuable on its own — not just for us, but for any creator who wants deeper AI collaboration. Keeping it private would waste that.

**What we learned:** The best documentation is a working example. Instead of writing abstract guides, we kept the live project (Leland, memories, skills) as the reference implementation. Theory and practice in the same repo.

## 2026-04-07 — Journal over daily log

**What we decided:** Use a decision-based journal instead of a chronological daily log (HISTORY.md).

**Why:** Daily logs become noise fast — thousands of lines nobody reads. Decision entries stay useful because they capture *why* something was chosen, not just *what* happened on a given day.

**What we learned:** The unit of documentation for a collaboration process is the **decision**, not the **day**.

## 2026-04-07 — Memory lives in the project, not hidden in the system

**What we decided:** All memory files live in the project's `memory/` folder, visible and editable by the human. Mirrored to `.claude/projects/` for system auto-load.

**Why:** The creator needs full visibility and control over what the AI remembers. Hidden state breaks trust. If you can't see it, you can't fix it.

**What we learned:** Transparency is a design principle, not a feature. A collaboration interface where one side has hidden memory is not a collaboration — it's a black box.

## 2026-04-07 — Conversations in Portuguese, artifacts in English

**What we decided:** All files, code, comments, and documentation are written in English. All conversation with the user stays in Portuguese (BR).

**Why:** English maximizes reach and keeps technical content accessible to the global community. Portuguese keeps the working conversation comfortable and natural for the creator.

**What we learned:** Language convention is one of the first decisions to make — it touches everything. Define it early, enforce it always.
